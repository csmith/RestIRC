h2. What is it?

_RestIRC_ aims to provide a REST-ful interface to IRC. The primary use-case is
to allow websites, scripts and applications to quickly and easily interact with
IRC to, for example, notify certain channels about events. After that, the goal
is to enable remote scripts and applications to listen to and respond to events
by registering WebHooks.

Ideally, it will eventually be possible to write a full IRC client on top of
the API without having to interact with IRC itself directly.
